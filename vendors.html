				<p>
					Here at MadeSimple, we do our utmost best to help small businesses grow. At first we wanted to provide our community with a list of local producers but at the end of the day we couldn't see it having any real impact.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So instead we turned to what is our current solution: Buy your groceries from small businesses, our partners, and deliver it straight to you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					At the end of the day, you're happy because grocery shopping has become that much easier, our partners are happy because they see an increase in sales, and lastly we are happy because of you.

				<h2>
					Our Standards
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					Just so you know, we don't just let anyone partner with us.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We have a set standard to ensure that everything we deliver is of the highest quality.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This means, visiting farms, taste-tests, interviewing the producers and somtimes we even interview the animals too.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I mean nobody wants mistreated animals, right?
